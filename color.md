# Color
Color is very important in design. It affects how users perceive and interact with a product. However, color is perceived differently in various cultural contexts, and there are also several color impairments and color combinations to consider. Using color thoughtfully ensures accessibility and improves the user experience.

## Color systems

Colors are represented and processed using different systems depending on the medium:

- RGB: Used for digital screens, based on red, green, and blue light.
- CMYK: Used for printing, based on cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black) inks.

Understanding these systems ensures accurate and consistent color representation across mediums.

## Color impairments

Color impairments, such as color blindness, affect how people perceive colors. Common types include:

- Protanopia (difficulty seeing red)
- Deuteranopia (difficulty seeing green)
- Tritanopia (difficulty seeing blue)

Designs should avoid relying solely on color to convey meaning. Use labels, patterns, or textures as additional cues to ensure accessibility.

## Different meanings of color in cultural contexts

Colors hold different meanings across cultures. For example:

- White: Purity in Western cultures but mourning in some Eastern cultures.
- Red: Luck and prosperity in China but can signify danger in other contexts.

When designing for a global audience, consider these cultural nuances to avoid misunderstandings or unintended symbolism.

## Color contrast

Contrast is crucial for readability and usability. Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors, especially for small text or critical information. Use tools like contrast checkers to meet accessibility standards, such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

## Testing color

Testing color ensures it works as intended for all users:

- Use accessibility tools to simulate color impairments and check color contrast.
- Test designs on different devices and lighting conditions.
- Gather feedback from diverse users to ensure inclusivity and usability.
