# Dark patterns
Dark patterns are misleading practices that disrupt the user or have unexpected outcome.



## Common dark patterns

- Repeated disruption
  - Popups - asking users to subscribe to a newsletter or asking other stuff they don't want to do.
- Creating fear of missing out
  - Notifying users with artificial limits, like "there are only 7 items left".
  - Notifying users that other people are also looking at the same offer, pressuring them to complete a booking or purchase.
- Misleading elements
  - Ads that are styled like content, so that users accidentally click on it.
  - Not labeling something as AI generated content.
- Fake reference pricing
  - Showing prices that are not true, indicating to the user that they are saving a lot of money, which is not actually the case.
- Preselection
  - Users have to actively opt-out for receiving a newsletter, instead of opting in.
  - Adding insurance to tickets automatically
- Increasing difficulty to opt-out
  - Adding hurdles to opt-out of something, like cancelling a subscription or deleting something
  - Shaming users to opt-out
- Confirmsharing
  - Making the user click on something that tells them that they are missing out on a really good offer, giving them the impression that they make a bad decision.
