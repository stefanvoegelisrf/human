## How Habits Are Formed

- **Cue**: The habit starts with a clear and visible cue that grabs your attention. For example, setting out running shoes by the door reminds you to go for a jog.  
- **Craving**: The cue creates a desire or motivation to act. This is the feeling that makes you want to do the habit, like imagining how good you'll feel after exercising.  
- **Response**: This is the action or behavior itself—the habit you perform. It should be simple and achievable, especially at the start, like going for a quick 10-minute walk.  
- **Reward**: After completing the habit, there’s an immediate and satisfying reward. This could be a sense of accomplishment, enjoyment, or a small treat, which helps reinforce the habit and makes you want to repeat it.

### How to achieve long term habits

The problem with good long term habits is, that the reward takes a long time to develop. To better achieve long term habits, it's good to have short term feedback. When trying to achieve long term habits, we expect it to come quickly. However this is an unrealistic expectation, the results of our efforts arrive delayed and we often only realize later on what we have achieved. This can lead to a "valley of disappointment" where we don't value the work we put as we don't really realize the results, but the work we put in is never wasted.
