# Tactile System – Sense of Touch

The tactile system allows us to feel physical sensations like pressure, temperature, and texture. It’s responsible for detecting changes in the environment through skin contact.

## How the Tactile System Works

The skin is equipped with specialized receptors that respond to different types of touch. These receptors transmit information to the brain, allowing us to perceive sensations like smoothness, roughness, and pressure. 

- **Pressure Receptors**: Detect changes in pressure on the skin.
- **Vibration Receptors**: Respond to vibrations or moving stimuli.
- **Passive Touch**: Some receptors detect light touch, like the sensation of clothing on our skin.
  
Certain areas of the body, such as the fingertips, lips, and tongue, have a higher concentration of tactile receptors, making them more sensitive. For example, the tactile system allows us to recognize objects by touch, even without looking at them.

## Impairments

- **Disturbance of Tactile Reception**: This can range from minor sensations to complete numbness. It may result from nerve damage or neurological conditions.
  
## Coordination with Visual System

The tactile and visual systems often work together. For example, when you use your hands to type, your sense of touch tells you what the keys feel like, while your visual system helps you see where the keys are.

## Derivations for Design

- **Haptic Feedback**: Devices like controllers use haptic feedback to simulate the sensation of touch, such as when you feel a vibration or resistance.
- **Tactile Devices for the Visually Impaired**: Devices can translate visual information into tactile sensations, such as Braille displays or specialized keyboards.
- **Virtual Environments**: By using tactile devices like gloves or suits, virtual reality systems can simulate real-world sensations like texture, weight, or pressure.
