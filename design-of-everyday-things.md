# Design of Everyday Things

Design shapes how we interact with the world, whether it's opening a door, using a tool, or navigating a website. Good design is intuitive and user-friendly, while poor design leads to confusion.

## Conceptual Model
The conceptual model is how people understand how something works. A good design makes it easy to match the user's mental model with the actual system.

**Example:**  
A folder icon on a computer gives the idea that it contains files, just like a real-life folder.

---

## Affordances
Affordances refer to the possible actions that an object suggests to the user. They show what you can do with the object based on its design.

**Example:**  
A door handle affords pulling, while a flat plate on a door affords pushing.

---

## Signifiers
Signifiers are clues or signals that indicate where and how to interact with an object. They guide the user by showing what to do.

**Example:**  
A "Push" label on a door, or a blinking cursor in a text field to indicate where to type.

---

## Mappings
Mappings describe the relationship between controls and their effects. Good mappings make it obvious what action corresponds to what result.

**Example:**  
A stove where the knobs are aligned with the burners they control has good mapping. Misaligned knobs make it confusing to know which burner will turn on.

---

## Feedback
Feedback is the response a user gets after interacting with a product. It confirms that the action was successful or shows an error if it wasnâ€™t.

**Example:**  
A click sound when you press a button on a remote, or an elevator button lighting up after being pressed.
