## Perception

**Attention** is the brain's ability to select certain pieces of information while ignoring others. This process serves as the foundation for **perception**, which is how we interpret and make sense of the world around us.

We are constantly bombarded with stimuli from our environment. Depending on where we focus our attention, some stimuli are transmitted to our sensory organs for further processing. 

Think of attention as a filter that helps us decide which information to focus on and process actively. 

> The human brain processes approximately **70,000 stimuli per second**, but only about **70 stimuli are processed actively**. Of the information we receive, **70–90% is visual**. This highlights the importance of visual inputs in how we perceive and interact with the world.

## Visual Hierarchy

To support users’ perception, we use **visual hierarchy**. This helps them quickly get an overview of content and identify the parts that are most relevant to them. A strong visual hierarchy guides their attention and makes information easier to understand and act upon.

### Tools to Create Visual Hierarchy
Here are some key tools for building visual hierarchy, along with simple examples:

- **Patterns**: Repeating elements like colors, shapes, or layouts can make content predictable and easier to follow. Example: Websites often use consistent navigation bars at the top.
- **Typography**: Using different fonts, sizes, or weights to highlight important text. Example: Headlines are typically larger and bolder than body text.
  - 35 to 75 characters per line are ideal
  - Use flutter set
  - Combine serif fonts with sans-serif fonts
  - Combining similar fonts makes no sense
  - Choose fonts that create a good contrast between each other
  - Try to stick to two fonts, max. three fonts
  - Don't mix moods of fonts
  - Use different weights within the fonts
- **Images**: Pictures or illustrations can grab attention and communicate messages faster than words. Example: Product images on e-commerce sites help users decide quickly.
- **Contrast**: Differences in color, size, or brightness can emphasize key elements. Example: A bright "Buy Now" button on a darker background.
- **Color**: Colors can evoke emotions or direct focus. Example: Red often signals urgency or warnings, while green is associated with success or approval.
- **Icons**: Simple visual symbols can replace or complement text. Example: A magnifying glass icon to represent search functionality.
- **Layouts**: Arranging elements in a way that flows naturally for users. Example: Grid-based layouts help organize content neatly.
- **Grids**: Dividing space evenly helps maintain alignment and structure. Example: Newspapers use grids for a clean, organized look.
- **Branding**: Consistent use of logos, colors, and styles reinforces identity and makes content recognizable. Example: Coca-Cola’s iconic red and white color scheme.

### Key Concepts in Visual Hierarchy

- **Picture Superiority Effect**: Research shows that pictures are processed approximately **60,000 times faster** than text and are remembered better. This is why visuals often make a stronger impact than plain words.
  
- **Facial Recognition**: Humans are hardwired to recognize faces, even in abstract shapes or patterns. Faces naturally attract attention, making them a powerful tool in design. Example: A smiling face in a product ad can draw viewers' eyes and create a connection.


By applying these tools and concepts effectively, we can design content that resonates with users and guides their attention in meaningful ways.

### Saccadic Jumps

When we read, our eyes move in quick, jerky motions called **saccadic movements**. These movements allow the eyes to "jump" to the next position approximately every **200 milliseconds (ms)**. The jump itself—when the eyes are moving—takes only about **5 to 10 ms**. 

Interestingly, we only perceive information when our eyes are holding still, not during the jump. This means that the brain processes visual information in brief bursts as the eyes pause between jumps.

> Example: When reading a sentence, your eyes don’t move smoothly across the text. Instead, they make small jumps, pausing briefly on certain words or letters. These pauses, or **fixations**, are when the brain processes the text.

### Micro and Macro

When presenting information, it’s crucial to clearly state the most important details upfront. This ensures that users can quickly identify what matters most, whether they’re skimming for key points (macro focus) or looking for specific details (micro focus).

#### Tips for Prioritizing Information:
- **Macro (big picture):** Highlight the primary takeaway. Use bold headlines, larger font sizes, or contrasting colors to make the key message stand out.
  - *Example*: On a product page, the price, product name, and a "Buy Now" button should be the most prominent elements.
  
- **Micro (details):** Organize supporting information in a way that’s easy to scan and read. Use bullet points, smaller text, or collapsible sections to manage detailed content.
  - *Example*: On the same product page, detailed specifications or reviews can be placed below the main information.

By addressing both macro and micro perspectives, you cater to different user needs—those looking for a quick summary and those diving into the finer details. This approach improves usability and ensures key messages aren’t missed.

## How are stories told and written?

### 1. To win people over, create tension between the "status quo" (how things are now) and a "better way" (how things could be).
   - **Why?** People are drawn to stories where there’s a problem (the status quo) and a solution (the better way). The tension between these two keeps them engaged and makes them care about the outcome.
   - **Example:** "We used to believe X, but then Y happened, and we discovered Z, which is so much better."

### 2. Good fortune stories 
   - These stories often follow this pattern:  
     1. **We thought this was the solution** – At first, we believed we had the answer.  
     2. **We were wrong** – Something didn’t work, or an unexpected twist occurred.  
     3. **We found something better** – Here’s the improved solution or insight we discovered.  
   - **Example:** "We thought success was about working harder, but then we realized working smarter was the real key!"

### 3. Journalism structure
   - **The lead** – The most important information goes here (Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?).  
   - **The body** – The details and context that help explain the story.  
   - **The tail** – Extra information or background that’s less critical but still interesting if you want to dive deeper.  
   - **Why this structure?** It ensures readers get the essential facts quickly, even if they don’t finish reading.

### 4. Academic writing
   - Academic papers have a standard format:  
     1. **Introduction** – What question or problem is being studied? Why does it matter?  
     2. **Methods** – How was the research conducted?  
     3. **Results** – What was discovered?  
     4. **Discussion** – What do the results mean? How do they fit into the bigger picture?  
   - **Why this structure?** It makes research clear and easy to follow for others.

### 5. Web writing
   - For online content, use this order of importance:  
     1. **Most important info** – Put the key points up front.  
     2. **Important info** – Add supporting details.  
     3. **Good-to-have info** – Include helpful extras, if space allows.  
     4. **Least important info** – Save the least critical details for last.  
   - **Why this structure?** People often skim online, so front-loading the most important info ensures they quickly find what they need.

## Mental traps (biases)

Our brain fills in gaps with limited information, which can lead to false conclusions influenced by biases.

---

### 1. Cognitive dissonance
   - **What is it?** Holding two conflicting beliefs causes mental stress, discomfort, and anxiety.  
   - **Example:** Believing in healthy living but smoking at the same time creates inner conflict.

### 2. Spotlight effect
   - **What is it?** We think others are paying more attention to us than they actually are.  
   - **Example:** You think everyone notices a small mistake, but most people didn’t even notice it.

### 3. Anchoring effect
   - **What is it?** We rely too much on the first piece of information (anchor) to make decisions, even when it’s unnecessary.  
   - **Example:** Seeing a high price for something makes you think a lower price is a good deal, even if it’s still expensive.

### 4. Halo effect
   - **What is it?** The first impression of someone or something influences how we see everything about them.  
   - **Example:** A person who is attractive might be assumed to be more intelligent, even without evidence.

### 5. Gambler's Fallacy
   - **What is it?** Believing that future events are influenced by past ones, even when they are independent.  
   - **Example:** Thinking a coin toss is "due" to land heads after several tails, even though each toss is random.

### 6. The contrast effect
   - **What is it?** Things are judged as more extreme when compared to something very different.  
   - **Example:** A small house feels larger when compared to a tiny apartment next to it.

### 7. Confirmation bias
   - **What is it?** We tend to search for, interpret, or remember information in a way that confirms our existing beliefs, while ignoring information that contradicts them.  
   - **Example:** If you believe a certain diet works, you'll focus on success stories and ignore evidence that contradicts it.

### 8. Loss aversion bias
   - **What is it?** We feel the pain of losing something more intensely than the pleasure of gaining something of equal value.  
   - **Example:** You might avoid selling a stock at a small loss, even though it’s a good decision in the long run, because the loss feels worse than the potential gain feels good.

### 9. Ambiguity aversion
   - **What is it?** We tend to avoid options that are uncertain or unclear, even if those options might be beneficial.  
   - **Example:** Choosing a well-known brand over a new, less familiar one, even when the new brand might offer a better product.

### 10. Status quo bias
   - **What is it?** We prefer things to stay the same, even if changing them would be beneficial.  
   - **Example:** Sticking with the same phone or software for years, even when newer, better options are available.

### 11. Endowment effect
   - **What is it?** We place more value on things simply because we own them.  
   - **Example:** Feeling unwilling to sell an item for more than you originally paid for it, even if you don't need it anymore.

### 12. Omission-commission bias
   - **What is it?** We tend to prefer inaction (omission) over action (commission) when faced with decisions that might lead to negative outcomes.  
   - **Example:** Not taking action or making a decision because you feel it's better to do nothing than risk making a mistake.
