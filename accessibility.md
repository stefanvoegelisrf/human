# Accessibility

Designing interfaces or products which are accessible to most users is very important. Therefore it is important to know what disabilites exist and how we can design our interfaces to take these disabilites into account. Disabilities can and will affect any one of us, as we will get older.

## Spectrums of Disability

There are 5 main forms of disability:  

- **Cognitive**:  
  Cognitive disabilities affect how people process information, focus, or learn. Examples include dyslexia, ADHD, and memory impairments.  
  **Support in design**: Use clear and simple language, consistent layouts, icons with text labels, and avoid overly complex navigation. Include options like text-to-speech and avoid animations that could cause distractions.  

- **Visual**:  
  Visual disabilities range from color blindness and low vision to complete blindness.  
  **Support in design**: Ensure text has sufficient contrast, provide alternative text for images, use scalable fonts, and make the interface compatible with screen readers. Avoid relying solely on color to convey information.  

- **Auditory**:  
  Auditory disabilities include partial or total hearing loss.  
  **Support in design**: Provide captions or transcripts for audio content, use visual alerts instead of sound-based notifications, and allow users to adjust or disable sound effects.  

- **Motor**:  
  Motor disabilities impact a person’s ability to use their hands or control precise movements, such as with Parkinson’s disease or paralysis.  
  **Support in design**: Ensure the interface works with keyboard navigation, voice commands, and assistive technologies like switch controls. Design large clickable areas and avoid requiring complex gestures.  

- **Speech**:  
  Speech disabilities affect communication, such as difficulty speaking or being unable to speak.  
  **Support in design**: Provide alternative communication options like text-based inputs or chat features. Ensure voice-activated tools also have non-verbal alternatives.
