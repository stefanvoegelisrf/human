## What do we need to perceive?
- **Humans:** Most perception (80–90%) happens through the eyes.
- **Machines:** Use sensors like cameras to perceive visually.

## Key Concepts in Human Vision

1. **Anatomy of the Eye**
   - The eye is a complex organ with structures like the cornea, lens, retina, and optic nerve.

2. **Blind Spots**  
   - Areas where the eye lacks photoreceptors, creating gaps in vision, but the brain compensates.

3. **Retina and Photoreceptors**
   - The retina contains photoreceptors
     - 120 million rods for low light
     - 7 million cones for color
   - These are essential for detecting light and colors.

4. **Color Perception and Chromatic Aberration**
   - Color is perceived through cones sensitive to red, green, and blue light.
     - ca. 46% for red
     - ca. 46% for green
     - ca. 8% for blue
   - Chromatic aberration occurs when the lens fails to focus colors evenly, causing slight blurriness.

5. **Regulation of Vision**
   - The eye adjusts to brightness (pupil dilation) and focus (lens accommodation) to maintain clarity.

6. **Field of Vision and Orientation Reflex**
   - Humans have a wide field of vision, and the orientation reflex helps us quickly notice sudden movements or changes.

7. **Central Field of Vision (Sehschärfe)**  
- The **central field of vision** is the area in the middle of your visual field (around 5°). This is where **sharp vision** occurs, allowing us to see details clearly.  
- **Peripheral Vision:** Outside this central area, vision becomes **blurry** and less detailed. This is why we rely on **eye movements** to focus on things in our surroundings.  

8. **Visual Impairments**
   - **Shortsightedness (Myopia):** Difficulty seeing distant objects.
   - **Farsightedness (Hyperopia):** Difficulty seeing close objects.
   - **Color Vision Disorders:** Challenges in distinguishing colors, like red-green color blindness.
   - **Blindness/Partial Blindness:** Loss or reduction of vision.

## Eye Movements and Their Purpose

1. **Horizontal and Vertical Eye Movement Range**
   - Eyes can move **horizontally** about **±15°** and **vertically** from **0° to 30°** to help us scan our environment.
   - Beyond this range, we need to move our **head** to see more.

2. **Saccades (50 ms)**
   - A **saccade** is a quick, jerky movement of the eye that happens in less than **50 milliseconds**.
   - These rapid shifts in focus are **unconscious** and often unnoticed, as they happen too fast to be perceived.

3. **Fixation (250 - 1000 ms)**
   - After a saccade, the eyes typically **fixate** on a point for **250 ms to 1 second** to focus on the details of what we are looking at.

4. **Continuous Perception**
   - Despite the fact that our eyes are constantly moving (with saccades and fixations), we perceive a **continuous flow of visual information**.
   - This happens because our brain combines the snapshots from each fixation to create the illusion of a steady, uninterrupted view.

## Design considerations from the visual system

1. **Age:** Vision changes with age; designs should consider readability for older users.  
2. **Brightness and Contrast:** High contrast and appropriate brightness improve visibility.  
3. **Color:** Use accessible color schemes to account for color vision disorders.  
4. **Adaptation and Accommodation:** Designs should avoid strain by accommodating different lighting conditions and distances.  
5. **Movement:** Animations should be purposeful and not distract from the main content.

## Reading flow and readability
- Text should be easy to scan and read with clear fonts, sufficient spacing, and logical structure.
- Use visual hierarchy to guide the user's attention effectively.
