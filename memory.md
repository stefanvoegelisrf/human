## Memory Structure and How Information Flows

1. **Sensory Memory**  
   - Very short-term memory; information fades almost instantly.  
   - **Duration:** Less than half a second.  

2. **Primary Memory** (Short-Term Memory)  
   - Holds information temporarily but loses it if new information replaces it.  
   - **Duration:** A few seconds to a few minutes.  
   - **Capacity:** About 7 items at a time.  

3. **Secondary Memory** (Long-Term Memory)  
   - Stores information for longer periods but can forget due to interference (new or old memories blocking retrieval).  
   - **Duration:** Minutes to years.  

4. **Tertiary Memory** (Permanent Long-Term Memory)  
   - Stores information permanently, such as important facts, skills, and events.  
   - **Types:**  
     - **Declarative Memory:** Facts and events we consciously recall.  
     - **Procedural Memory:** Skills learned subconsciously, like riding a bike or typing.  
   - **What helps make memories permanent?**  
     - Importance of the information.  
     - Motivation to remember it.  
     - Strong emotions associated with it.

## How Much Do We Remember?  

- **10%** of what we read.  
- **20%** of what we hear.  
- **30%** of what we see.  
- **50%** of what we both hear and see.  
- **70%** of what we discuss or explain.  
- **90%** of what we practice or do ourselves.  


## The Primacy and Recency Effects: How We Remember Information  

When we try to remember a list of items, our memory tends to be better for items at the beginning and the end of the list. This happens due to two effects: the **primacy effect** and the **recency effect**. Here's how they work:  

### Primacy Effect

The **primacy effect** means we remember the first item on a list better than the ones in the middle.

**Why does this happen?**  
- The first item is often repeated more during learning. For example, when you start a list, you might say the first item multiple times before moving on.  
- At the start of learning, our **short-term memory** is still empty, so the first item gets more attention and space in memory.  
- With enough repetition, the first item might even move into long-term memory.  

### Recency Effect

The **recency effect** means we remember the last item on a list better than the ones in the middle.

**Why does this happen?**  
- The last item is still fresh in our **short-term memory** when we try to recall it.  
- It hasn’t had time to be replaced or “pushed out” by new information.  

## Why Are the Middle Items Harder to Remember?

The items in the middle of the list don’t benefit from the same advantages as the first or last ones:  
- They aren’t repeated as much as the first item.  
- They don’t stay fresh in short-term memory like the last item.  
As a result, they’re more likely to be forgotten unless you use special strategies, like grouping or connecting them to something meaningful.

## Understanding Spatial Memory in UX Design

Spatial memory is the ability to recall the location of things by interacting with them repeatedly. In user interfaces (UIs), it helps users quickly find controls without searching visually. To support spatial memory, designers should:

- **Use clear boundaries**: Define areas of controls with obvious visual boundaries, like toolbars.
- **Make objects positionally stable**: Avoid reflowing the layout when the viewport size changes, as it disrupts users' ability to relocate objects.
- **Use landmarks**: Make prominent objects stand out, like the search bar or hero carousel, to help users remember where objects are.
- **Avoid adaptive interfaces**: Rearranging UI elements can break users' ability to build spatial memory.
- **Increase salience**: Supply visual or textual cues, like text labels or thumbnails, to help users find specific objects.
- **Use broad, shallow hierarchies**: Make the entire information space visible at the same time to expose users to all items and their locations.
