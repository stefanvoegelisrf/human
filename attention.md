## Properties of Attention

1. **Attention and Memory Connection**
   - Focused attention helps store information temporarily (around 15 seconds).
   - Without focus, information is quickly lost.

2. **Duration and Limits**
   - Attention holds information briefly unless reinforced through repetition or active engagement.

3. **Trainable Skill**
   - Attention can be improved with practice, enhancing multitasking abilities (e.g., reading while listening to dictation).

4. **Impact on Memory**
   - Better attention leads to stronger and more effective memory retention.

## Types of Attention

1. **Selective Attention**
   - When you focus completely on one specific thing while ignoring everything else around you.
   - **Example:** Listening to your friend talk in a noisy café while tuning out the background chatter.

2. **Shared Attention**
   - The ability to focus on multiple things at the same time, though usually with less focus on each.
   - **Example:** Driving while listening to music or having a conversation.

3. **Conscious Attention**
   - Attention that requires deliberate effort and awareness. You actively choose to focus on something.
   - **Example:** Solving a math problem or learning a new skill.

4. **Subconscious Attention**
   - Happens automatically, without you realizing it, often driven by habits or reflexes.
   - **Example:** Noticing the sound of your name in a crowded room or automatically braking when you see a red light while driving.

## Attention on Colors

1. **Colored vs. Gray:**
   - Brightly colored objects grab attention faster than gray or dull ones.
   - **Example:** A red button stands out more than a gray one.

2. **Pure vs. Mixed Colors:**
   - Pure, solid colors attract more attention than blended or muted shades.
   - **Example:** A bright blue icon is noticed more quickly than a pastel blue one.

3. **Saturation/Intensity:**
   - Bold, highly saturated colors are more eye-catching than faded or low-intensity ones.
   - **Example:** A vivid orange sign is harder to miss than a pale orange one.

4. **Warm vs. Cool Colors:**
   - Warm colors like red, orange, and yellow draw more attention than cooler tones like blue or green.
   - **Example:** A yellow warning sign is noticed faster than a blue one.

5. **Multi-Colored vs. Single-Colored:**
   - Objects with multiple colors grab more attention than those with just one color.
   - **Example:** A rainbow logo stands out more than a plain red one.

## Global vs. Selective Processing  

1. **Global Processing:**  
   - Focus on the overall structure or larger picture first.  
   - Example: Identifying a large shape or pattern before noticing smaller details.  

2. **Selective Processing:**  
   - Focus on specific, detailed elements within the larger structure.  
   - Example: Noticing small components, like individual parts of a pattern.  

### Key Insight:  
- **Global processing comes first.**  
- The brain starts by understanding the big picture and then moves to finer details.

## Serial vs. Parallel Processing

1. **Serial Processing**
   - The brain focuses on **one task or piece of information at a time**, processing it step by step.
   - **Implications for UX:**
     - Ensure tasks requiring attention are simple and sequential.
     - Avoid overloading users with too much information at once.
     - Example: Step-by-step wizards or guided workflows.

2. **Parallel Processing**
   - The brain processes **multiple streams of information simultaneously**, but typically at a shallower level for each.
   - **Implications for UX:**
     - Use for tasks where users need to process multiple inputs at once (e.g., dashboards).
     - Avoid overcomplexity to prevent cognitive overload.
     - Example: A car’s dashboard where users can simultaneously monitor speed, fuel, and navigation.
