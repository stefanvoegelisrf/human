## Aesthetic-Usability Effect

When design is aesthetic, users perceive it as more usable.

- Aesthetically pleasing design triggers a positive response in the user and they think it works better
- Users tend to ignore minor usability issues when it is aesthetic
- It is possible that aesthetically pleasing design hides usability flaws

## Chunking

To make a lot of information easier to digest, it is split up into smaller parts and then grouped together.

- Chunking allows users to quickly scan over content and identify what is most relevant for them to achieve their goals
- Chunking allows to create clear hierarchy and support the user in evaluating and processing the content

## Cognitive Bias

Human decisions and behaviors are influenced by biases, affecting user experience.

- We don't think through every possible situation, instead we take shortcuts which make us more efficient and enable us to make quicker decisions. This can also influence our decisions and judgements without our awareness.
- We need to be aware of our biases to better understand them and take them into consideration so that we don't blindly apply them which could lead to unintentional discrimination, false reasoning or costly mistakes
- An example is the confirmation bias where we seek for validation about what we already know.

## Cognitive load

The cognitive load describes the amount of content we can consume at a time.

- Too much load can overload us and make us overwhelmed and we also miss details.
- Intrinsic cognitive load is the mental effort needed to understand and remember information that’s important to what we're trying to do.
- Extraneous cognitive load is the extra mental effort caused by things that don't help us understand what we're doing, like confusing or unnecessary design features.

## Doherty Threshold

When interaction is too slow between users and a system, the productivity decreases. The interaction delay should be lower than 400ms.

- We can hide waiting times by pretending that something is happening
- Animation can be used to engage with the user that something is happening in the background
- Progress indicators can make wait times more tolerable, if they are also fun to watch, they can make it even more tolerable.
- If something happens very fast, adding a delay can increase the perceived value of a process

## Fitt's Law

This describes how long it takes a user to reach a target. This duration increases with the distance and the size of the target.

- Touch targets should be sized accurately and have good spacing in between
- Touch targets should be place where they can be easily reached

## Flow

Flow is a mental state where we are fully focused and involved in an activity.

- Flow occurs when difficulty of a task and the skill level are balanced. Allowing us to be in control and focus on the task at hand.
- When tasks are too easy or too difficult, they can lead to boredom.
- Indicate progress to the user to the user has feedback on what has been achieved.
- Optimize interfaces for efficiency to remove friction

## Goal Gradient Effect

The goal gradient effect describes that we work faster towards a goal, the closer we get to it.

- Artificial progress can be provided so that users have more motivation to reach the goal

## Hick's Law

Hick's law describes that it takes us more time to make a decision when we an increased amount and more complex choices.

- When time is critical, reduce the amount of choices.
- Decrease cognitive load by breaking choices into smaller parts.
- Highlight recommended options to guide the users.
- Use progressive onboarding to avoid overloading users.
- Don't simplify until it gets too abstract

## Jakob's Law

Jakob's law describes that users are accustomed for things to work in a certain way, which they are used from other places, so we should not confuse them with other patterns.

- Users will expect our interface to work like other interfaces that they already know.
- By applying already known patterns, we can create better experiences instead of users having to learn new patterns.
- When known patterns are changed, allow users to transition to the new patterns slowly. They can use it the old way for a limited amount of time and should slowly get used to the new way of doing things.

## Law of Common Region

When items are inside clear boundaries, they are perceived to belong together.

- By defining clear boundaries(e.g. borders, background), we can add hierarchy and show the relationship of elements.

## Law of Proximity

Users tend to think that items that are close to each other, belong to each other and they group them.

- Elements that are near to each other are perceived to work the same way and have the same properties
- Proximity helps to organize content and increase efficiency

## Law of Prägnanz

Users will abstract complex forms to their simplest form possible as it requires less effort.

- The brain likes to simplify as this reduces the chance to get overwhelmed.
- Simpler shapes are easier to recognize than complex shapes.

## Law of Similarity

When elements look similar, they appear to have a relationship to each other, even if they are separated.

- Color, shape and size are indicators that elements share the same properties, are related to each other or have the same kind of functionality

## Law of Uniform Connectedness

When elements are connected to each other, they appear related.

- Use groups for functions of the same category by using color, lines, frames or other shapes. We can also use line that lead to the next element to show a connection.
