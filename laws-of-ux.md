# Laws of UX
There are several "laws" to take into account when desigining interfaces to make them more usable.

- [Laws of UX](#laws-of-ux)
  - [Aesthetic-Usability Effect](#aesthetic-usability-effect)
  - [Chunking](#chunking)
  - [Cognitive Bias](#cognitive-bias)
  - [Cognitive load](#cognitive-load)
  - [Doherty Threshold](#doherty-threshold)
  - [Fitt's Law](#fitts-law)


## Aesthetic-Usability Effect

When design is aesthetic, users perceive it as more usable.

- Aesthetically pleasing design triggers a positive response in the user and they think it works better
- Users tend to ignore minor usability issues when it is aesthetic
- It is possible that aesthetically pleasing design hides usability flaws

## Chunking

To make a lot of information easier to digest, it is split up into smaller parts and then grouped together.

- Chunking allows users to quickly scan over content and identify what is most relevant for them to achieve their goals
- Chunking allows to create clear hierarchy and support the user in evaluating and processing the content

## Cognitive Bias

Human decisions and behaviors are influenced by biases, affecting user experience.

- We don't think through every possible situation, instead we take shortcuts which make us more efficient and enable us to make quicker decisions. This can also influence our decisions and judgements without our awareness.
- We need to be aware of our biases to better understand them and take them into consideration so that we don't blindly apply them which could lead to unintentional discrimination, false reasoning or costly mistakes
- An example is the confirmation bias where we seek for validation about what we already know.

## Cognitive load

The cognitive load describes the amount of content we can consume at a time.

- Too much load can overload us and make us overwhelmed and we also miss details.
- Intrinsic cognitive load is the mental effort needed to understand and remember information thatâ€™s important to what we're trying to do.
- Extraneous cognitive load is the extra mental effort caused by things that don't help us understand what we're doing, like confusing or unnecessary design features.

## Doherty Threshold

When interaction is too slow between users and a system, the productivity decreases. The interaction delay should be lower than 400ms.

- We can hide waiting times by pretending that something is happening
- Animation can be used to engage with the user that something is happening in the background
- Progress indicators can make wait times more tolerable, if they are also fun to watch, they can make it even more tolerable.
- If something happens very fast, adding a delay can increase the perceived value of a process
