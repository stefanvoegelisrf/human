# Motivation
Motivation is a key part of the human - system interaction. Each person has a different motivation to use a system and it is very important to get to know, what motivation our users could have.

## What are our primary motivations?
As humans, our primary motivations are:
- Surviving
- Survival of the species
- Avoid pain
- Seek pleasure
- Preserve energy

## Human needs

To understand motivation, it help to know that we do things to serve our needs. An older understanding of our needs is defined with the Maslow-pyramid, which has the following components in ascending order:

1. **Physiological Needs**: Basic survival needs such as food, water, shelter, and sleep.  
2. **Safety Needs**: Security, stability, and protection from harm.  
3. **Love and Belonging**: Relationships, social connections, and a sense of community.  
4. **Esteem Needs**: Self-respect, recognition, and achievement.  
5. **Self-Actualization**: The realization of personal potential, creativity, and growth.  

Maslow later added a **sixth level**, **self-transcendence**, focusing on altruism and meaning beyond the self.

Our needs are always a balancing act between autonomy and belonging. Within autonomy, we have control, freedom and spontaneity. Wheres within belonging, we have can participate, harmonize and receive support. In between is a playing ground for us to have challenges, learn, be creative and play.

## Stress factors

We have several stress factors, which are:

- **Novelty**: Encountering new or unfamiliar situations that challenge our ability to adapt. The brain perceives uncertainty in novel scenarios as a potential threat, activating stress responses.  
- **Unpredictability**: When we cannot anticipate events or outcomes, it creates anxiety and hyper-vigilance, as the brain struggles to prepare for the unknown.  
- **Threat (to the ego)**: Situations that challenge our sense of self-worth, competence, or social standing can trigger stress, as they undermine personal identity or confidence.  
- **Sense of Control**: A perceived lack of control over circumstances heightens stress levels, as we feel powerless to influence or change outcomes, intensifying helplessness or frustration.  

These factors collectively activate the body's stress response systems, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and influence mental and physical well-being.

## Dopamine and Motivation: The Role of Rewards and Habits  

Dopamine drives motivation by making rewards feel important, encouraging us to take action toward goals. Intermittent reward schedules, where rewards are given unpredictably, are especially powerful in keeping us motivated and persistent. Examples include:  
1. **Casinos**, where wins are random.  
2. **Unavailable partners**, creating excitement through unpredictability.  
3. **Social media**, with unpredictable likes and notifications.  

To sustain motivation and maintain higher dopamine levels over time, certain practices can help:  
1. **Cold water exposure** (e.g., Wim Hof method) boosts dopamine naturally.  
2. **Intermittent fasting** can regulate and enhance dopamine sensitivity.  
3. **Oxytocin from social connections** supports emotional well-being.  
4. **Finding joy in effort**, or enjoying the process itself, helps build lasting motivation.  

These approaches balance short-term rewards with long-term habits, promoting healthier and more sustainable motivation.

## Motivation & Design

In designing for humans, we need to get to know the motivation of our users and how to apply this to our system or product. We can use several techniques which are explained below.

### Storyboarding

As a technique to get to know a users motivation, we can use storyboarding. In storyboarding we visualize a certain scenario in which a user uses our system. With a story board we can visualize the user journey from beginning to end. We not only visualize the user interface, but also take the context of the user into account. For this, we empathize with user and their needs.

### Hook Model

The **Hook Model** is a framework developed by Nir Eyal that helps to design habit-forming products. It focuses on creating a cycle of user engagement that triggers repeated use of a product or service. The model consists of four key elements:

1. **Trigger**: A trigger is what prompts the user to take action. This can be an external trigger, like a notification or advertisement, or an internal trigger, such as a user's desire or emotional state. Understanding the triggers that motivate your users is crucial to designing an effective product.

2. **Action**: The action is the behavior that the user performs in response to the trigger. This should be simple, easy, and rewarding enough to encourage the user to perform it again.

3. **Variable Reward**: Once the user takes action, they should receive a reward that varies in nature or outcome. This uncertainty increases user engagement because users return, hoping to receive a desirable outcome. This is the part that builds anticipation and reinforces the habit.

4. **Investment**: Finally, investment is the time, effort, or resources that the user contributes to the system. This could be uploading content, personalizing a profile, or providing feedback. This investment leads to a greater commitment and increases the likelihood of future engagement.

The Hook Model helps us design systems that keep users coming back by leveraging psychological triggers and rewards to form lasting habits. 

This model is especially useful when we aim to align user motivations with system actions, making the experience more engaging and user-centric.

### Patterns & Codes

In design, **patterns** and **codes** refer to established conventions, behaviors, and visual cues that users have learned over time and expect to encounter in various systems. These patterns and codes help users understand how to interact with a product or system without needing to relearn basic concepts. By aligning our design with these familiar patterns, we can create intuitive and user-friendly experiences.

#### Design Patterns
**Design patterns** are reusable solutions to common design problems that have been refined over time. They include visual or interaction patterns that users recognize and are comfortable with, such as button styles, navigation layouts, or modal windows. By using widely known design patterns, we can make interfaces more predictable and reduce the cognitive load for users. For example, placing a "back" button in the top left corner of an interface is a pattern that users instinctively know, reducing the need for explanation.

#### Cultural Codes
**Cultural codes** are the learned symbols, behaviors, and conventions within a given culture or society that influence how we interpret and interact with the world around us. In design, these codes help users understand how to engage with a product. For instance, a green color often signifies "go" or "success," while red signals "stop" or "danger." Leveraging cultural codes ensures that our designs resonate with users' existing knowledge, making them more intuitive and accessible.

#### Context-Specific Codes
In addition to general cultural codes, we must also consider **context-specific codes** that may vary depending on the environment or situation in which the user interacts with the product. These could include factors such as body language, tone of voice, or the physical setting of the interaction. For example, in a quiet, professional setting, a soft notification sound may be appropriate, while in a social or casual environment, a louder, more playful tone might be expected. Understanding and applying these context-specific codes helps tailor the experience to users' immediate needs and expectations.

By utilizing patterns and codes effectively, we can create interfaces and systems that feel familiar, natural, and intuitive, thereby improving user satisfaction and reducing friction in their interactions.
