# Human Factors in Digital Design

In its essence, when talking about human factors in digital design, we want to improve the human – system interaction, considering all the aspects of the human system. Differentiation human factors from ergonomics, user experience, usability and human centered design is difficult as they all play into each other. They however share that the human is at the center of the design process. We take the humans abilities, needs, desires, ideas and requirements into account. By having these in mind, we better know how humans think and interact. We also know their limitations and then can derive certain insights into the design of interactive systems. This enables us to optimize the interaction of a human – system interface and leads to simpler operation as well as better usability and user experience.
Human factors are present in many fields such as: psychology, engineering, industrial design, physiology, anthropometry, security, social influencing factors, cognitive abilities, cooperation, problem solving.

Interaction always happens with the human(user) which has a certain task to fulfill with a system that is embedded in an environment.

The graphic below illustrates what plays into the human – system interaction.
